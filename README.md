# Simple Services

This is `square/flow 1.0-alpha2`'s `Flow.Services`, with just the services, and some stuff renamed inside it.

Also includes tests, which the original Flow did *not* have.

Also doesn't have `MultiKey` yet. The `TreeKey` is called `Services.Child`.

This is an experiment, not a library.
