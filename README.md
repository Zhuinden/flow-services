# Simple Services

This is `square/flow 1.0-alpha2`'s `Flow.Services`, with just the services, and some stuff renamed inside it.

Also includes tests, which the original Flow did *not* have.

The `TreeKey` is called `Services.Child`.

The `MultiKey` is called `Services.Composite`.
The children inside a composite must point to their parents, which is different from the original Flow.

This is an experiment, not a library.
